# audio-playground
This is just some experimentation with the HTML5 audio API's.
Ideally, it will be a page where you can record clips, apply filters to them, and then assemble them.
We will see. 

If you're interested in running it:
  1. Use node v4.1.1. `nvm use` if you're using nvm
  2. `npm install`
  3. `npm run server` for dev server.

MDN has about the only guides available.
