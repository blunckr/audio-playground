# audio-playground
This is just some experimentation with the HTML5 audio API's.
Ideally, it will be a page where you can record clips, apply filters to them, and then assemble them.
We will see.

If you're interested in running it:
  1. `git submodule init && git submodule update`
  2. Use node v4.1.1. `nvm use` if you're using nvm
  3. `npm install`
  4. `npm run server` for dev server.

MDN has about the only guides available.

## future additions
* change setting on different effects
* update and delete effects
* different sources, including live and upload
* full control over inputs and outputs
